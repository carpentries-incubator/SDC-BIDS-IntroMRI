The goal of this lesson is to provide an introduction to the core concepts involved in working with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.
It is intended for learners with no prior experience.

The lesson will introduce different types of MRI modalities and how they can be easily organized and shared.
This lesson is also a pre-requisite for the [Structural][inc-smri], [Functional][inc-fmri] and [Diffusion][inc-dmri] MRI Data Analysis lessons, which go more in-depth into their respective MRI modalities.

Over the past decade, the neuroimaging field has produced (and continues to produce) incredible amounts of data.
As a result, the scientific community has developed a diverse set of tools to facilitate the access, analysis and visualization of this data.
This lesson will start you on a path towards using these tools effectively in your own work.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson assumes that you have some working knowledge of the Unix shell and Python.
> These requirements can be fulfilled by:
> - completing the Software Carpentry [Unix][swc-shell] and/or [Python][swc-python] lessons
> - previous exposure to these tools
