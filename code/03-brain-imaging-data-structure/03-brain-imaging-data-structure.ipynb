    "The [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201644) is a simple and intuitive way to organize and describe your neuroimaging and behavioural data. Neuroimaging experiments result in complicated data that can be arranged in several different ways. BIDS tackles this problem by suggesting a new standard (based on consensus from multiple researchers across the world) for the arrangement of neuroimaging datasets. Using the same organizational standard for all of your studies will also allow you to easily reuse your scripts and share data and code with other researchers.\n",
