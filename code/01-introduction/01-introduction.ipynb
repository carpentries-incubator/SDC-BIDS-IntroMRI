    "\n",
    "Python is rapidly becoming the standard language for data analysis, visualization and automated workflow building. It is a free and open-source software that is relatively easy to pick up by new programmers. In addition, with Python packages such as <code>Jupyter</code> one can keep an interactive code journal of analysis - this is what we'll be using in the workshop, and is, in fact, what you are currently using to view this workshop! Using Jupyter notebooks allows you to keep a record of all the steps in your analysis, enabling transparency and ease of code sharing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of Python is that it is maintained by a large user-base. Anyone can easily make their own Python packages for others to use. Therefore, there exists a *very* large codebase for you to take advantage of for your neuroimaging analysis; from basic statistical analysis and visualization tools to advanced machine learning and multivariate methods!\n",
